  <h1>Jian Min Lim</h1>
  <p>My good friends call me "Jin", pronounced like the drink. I am a professional chef of 6 years and decided to pursue Software Engineering last year.
    It took me 8 months from appying, supplementing my academic portfolio to be finally accepted into this program. I am extremely excited to apply my previous career experience
    into this new field. I am hoping to be able to create applications that will aid the workforce on all levels as well as programs that can help the sustainability of food resources and the environment.

  <h1>My interest</h1>
  <p> In my free time I enjoy volleyball and boardgames. You can usually find me in the early mornings in the school gym! 
    I also love hosting dinner and cooking new recipes for my friends. My favourite cuisines are Southeast Asian, Japanese, Italian and French</p>
