  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, my good friends call me Jin, pronounced like the drink. 
    After six succesful years as a professional chef, I decided to switch careers into software engineering. 
    The transition was not easy, it took 8 months to build up my academic portfolio to finally be accepted 
    into the Software Engineering program at the University of Guelph.
  </p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am skilled in Python, C, and web technologies. 
    I am eager to apply my academic knowledge, real-world problem-solving skills, and diverse professional experiences
    to contribute to a fast-paced, collaborative development team.
    My motivations come from a strong desire to create software that can improve workplace efficiency and harmony,
    while developing programs that support sustainability around food resources and the environment.
    Currently, I am actively seeking an entry-level software development role to leverage my continuous learning and passion for technology.
  </p>

  <h2>My interest</h2>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my free time I enjoy volleyball and boardgames. You can usually find me in the gym, during early mornings.
    I also love hosting dinner parties and cooking new recipes for my friends. My favourite cuisines are Southeast Asian, Japanese, Italian and French</p>

  
  <h1> Which program do I use the most? Why is software design important to me?</h1>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I use Visual Studio Code on windows the most. 
    I feel it is designed well because it supports most of the languages I use, such as javascript, HTML and Python. 
    I also find the visual designs help me immensely in distinguishing data types and lines of code, which makes coding easier for me.
    
        As the course(CIS1250) progresses, I am learning software design plays a vital role in software development. 
    Much like my personal experience in professional cooking, I see the development stage of a software akin to creating a recipe for a great dish.
    It is important to ensure the product we are creating and delivering meets the needs of the specific demographic it is intended for. 
    I particularly enjoy the concept of pausing to improve problem solving.
    In this increasingly fast-paced world, taking the time to gather information, designing/planning, implementing our solutions 
    and testing the product for accuracy is crucial in making a satisfying dish or program.
    Firstly, we have to gather our information by asking the right questions and communicating any assumptions we are making, to ensures we have the right ingredients for the solution.
    Next, we must plan our methods to reach our solution. We should be able to affirm that our choices made have clear reasoning and purpose. After implementing our solution, we should be able to test and compare it with our gathered requirements. Thus, verifying and validating our decisions. Lastly, we should always ensure our program can be maintained and modified when needed if ever a unforeseen circumstance arises.
    In the age of a growing population and dwindling resources, I think we all should take a step back and pause to plan for a better future.
