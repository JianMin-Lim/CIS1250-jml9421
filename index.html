  <h1>Jian Min Lim</h1>
  <p>My good friends call me "Jin", pronounced like the drink. I am a professional chef of 6 years and decided to pursue Software Engineering last year.
    After 8 long months of building my academic portfolio, I was finally accepted into the B.Comp Software Engineering program in UoGuelph. 
    I am extremely excited to apply my previous career experience into this new field.
    I am hoping to be able to create applications that will aid the workforce on all levels as well as programs that can help the sustainability of food resources and the environment.

  <h2>My interest</h2>
  <p> In my free time I enjoy volleyball and boardgames. You can usually find me in the early mornings in the school gym or rushing to class.
    I also love hosting dinner parties and cooking new recipes for my friends. My favourite cuisines are Southeast Asian, Japanese, Italian and French</p>
