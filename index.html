  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>My good friends call me "Jin", pronounced like the drink. I am a professional chef of 6 years and decided to pursue Software Engineering last year.
    After 8 long months of building my academic portfolio, I was finally accepted into the B.Comp Software Engineering program in UoGuelph. 
    I am extremely excited to apply my previous career experience into this new field.
    I am hoping to be able to create applications that will aid the workforce on all levels as well as programs that can help the sustainability of food resources and the environment.

  <h2>My interest</h2>
  <p> In my free time I enjoy volleyball and boardgames. You can usually find me in the early mornings in the school gym or rushing to class.
    I also love hosting dinner parties and cooking new recipes for my friends. My favourite cuisines are Southeast Asian, Japanese, Italian and French</p>

  
  <h1> Which program do I use the most? Why is software design important to me?</h1>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I use Visual Studio Code on windows the most. I feel it is designed well because it supports most of the languages I use, such as HTML and Python. I also find the visual designs help me immensely in distinguishing data types and lines of code, which makes coding easier for me.
    
    After a couple weeks of this course, software design has opened my eyes on the importance of planning your code. 
    Much like my personal experience in professional cooking, I see the development stage of a software akin to creating a recipe for great dish.
    It is important to ensure the product we are creating and delivering meets the needs of the specific demographic it is intended for. 
    I particularly enjoy the concept of pausing to encourage thinking for thorough understanding when approaching a problem. 
    I feel this can help with maintaining the integrity of a product rather than rushing to produce something for quick sales or for the sake of being a pioneer. 
    In the age of a growing population and dwindling resources, I think we all should take a step back to pause and plan for a better future.
